# Josh's 30 Days of Growth

### January 2021 to Feburary 2021

The plan:

* Learn Angular, TypeScript, and AWS
  * and apply those skills to my side project
    * https://github.com/YoCodingJosh/anime_stats
    * https://github.com/YoCodingJosh/anime_stats_ui
* Learn some Japanese
  * I'm using Duolingo but will be bringing an additional tool called [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/) for learning Kanji. In my opinion, Duolingo doesn't really teach Kanji that well.

* [January 8](days/Jan8.md)
* [January 9](days/Jan9.md)
* [January 10](days/Jan10.md)
