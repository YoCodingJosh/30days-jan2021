## Angular

Started work on the Angular port of my Anime Stats app. I decided to attempt a "split" development, with a separate backend and frontend.

My repo for the work is here: https://github.com/YoCodingJosh/anime_stats_ui

I got the home page displaying exactly like the current version, just need to work on the button logic that generates stuff for the MyAnimeList API and then takes the user to the MAL authorization page.

## Japanese

Did a quick lesson that essentially went over different sentences that use 風呂 (furo, bathtub) and 部屋 (heya, room). 部屋はどこですか？ = Where is the room?
