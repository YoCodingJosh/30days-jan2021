## Swift

I didn't do a bunch of work on [this](https://github.com/YoCodingJosh/Nyanpasu-iOS). I just wired up a state variable and incremented it on every button push. I also added a Text label and have it display that variable. 

## 日本語

私のなまいはJoshuaです。私は好きプログラミングです。えっと、
私は好きアニメと漫画です！😅 

I also did some Duolingo lessions.

PS: macOS's Japanese keyboard is awesome. 素晴らしい！
