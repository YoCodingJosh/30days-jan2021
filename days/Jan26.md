## Japanese

Took a refresher on greetings. Went over phrases like こんにちは (hello), おはようございます (good morning), ありがとうございます (thank you), よろしく (nice to meet you), お願いいたします (please). By the way, I *really* love Apple's Japanese keyboard, but it autocompleted half of these for me. (not sure if this all OS's do this, but really cool nonetheless)

I also did a lesson in "Intro 3" which covered the kanji for Kyoto and Tokyo, and phrases like 京都に住んでいます。(I live in Kyoto.) and 東京に住んでいません (I do not live in Tokyo).

またね！
