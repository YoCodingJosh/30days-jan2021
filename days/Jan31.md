The last day of the month!

## Japanese (日本語)

Practiced Hiragana 2, which covered some basic words like drink, hello, vegetables, alcohol, etc. (I would type out the hiragana, but my keyboard wants to autocorrect them to kanji lmao)

I also did a lesson in Home 1, which covered some phrases like: 窓わどこですか？ (Where is the window?); ペットはにありません。(I do not have a pet.). It also covered some kanji for words like: window (窓), garden (庭), room (部屋) etc.
