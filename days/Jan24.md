I had a lazy day today and didn't do very much. Don't want to get burned out (I say that as I had 1 miss day in the past week 😅).

# Japanese

I did a lesson in counting, I went over phrases like: I will eat three eggs. (卵を三個食べます。); I have 2 apples. (りんごが二個あります。); etc.

# Angular

I did some pondering about moving forward with Angular (or a related framework like React/Vue/Svelte/et al). 

My reservations going forward with Angular specifically:

* I have to buy-in 100% into Angular, I can't easily<sup>*</sup> have only one page be Angular-ized
    * \*: I haven't searched to see if there is a way to do so.
* Having to manage two codebases (one is hard enough!) that depend on each other. This is pretty much tied to the first bullet point, but still an important topic.

I'm still going to finish this port, at least as a proof of concept to get familiar with Angular. 😁
