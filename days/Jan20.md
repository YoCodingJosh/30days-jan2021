## ASP. NET

I think I have ADHD lmao, I keep switching topics lmao. I have a good reason though, as I'm transitioning to a project that uses ASP .NET. I have prior experience with ASP .NET, but it's been a few years and I'm a bit rusty with it and so I practiced with it some today.

I made a simple MVC app that interfaces with MyAnimeList. There is a single endpoint right now `/Anime/{id}` where id is an anime id. That endpoint just displays some of the info like studios, genres, and the promo/logo image. An example is `/Anime/32901` which will return the data for [Eromanga Sensei](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32901). I used a cached API (that doesn't require auth) for MyAnimeList called Jikan.moe and a wrapper called [Jikan.net](https://github.com/Ervie/jikan.net).

The repo for my code is here: https://github.com/YoCodingJosh/DotNetAnimeWebApp

## Japanese
