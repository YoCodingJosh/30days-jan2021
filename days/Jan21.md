## Japanese

I did a lesson in Home 1, which reinforced the words: ペット (pet), トイレ (bathroom/toilet/restroom), and テーブル (table) and using them in sentences. トイレはどこですか？ (where is the bathroom?)

## Angular

I ported over the random error gif feature from the old app for the error page.

I still need a way to get the real error details from the server, because I just use EJS to interpolate the error on the page in the old app.
