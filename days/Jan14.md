## Japanese

Took a lesson for Intro 3 which was some useless phrases like "I am not an elementary school student." and "I am a middle school student." and number grade variations. I would write out the hiragana examples, but I'm too lazy for this lesson.

I took another lesson for Home 1, which was permutations of phrases like: 窓です (It is a window) and　庭はあそこです。 (The garden is over there.)

私はほんと好き学習日本語。	ヽ(*⌒▽⌒*)ﾉ
