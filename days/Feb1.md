I did some coding but it was fixing a bug in Anime Stats that was caused by MyAnimeList introducing a breaking API change. The bug caused some anime to not be counted for statistics which is a pretty big deal. Turns out that it only affected any NSFW anime ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).

The fix was simple and was explained in this forum post: https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1892917 and it's just appending `&nsfw=1` to the requests for list info.

I applied the fix and boom it works! No longer is there a ~2 day watch-time gap between what MAL reports and what my app reports. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I also added more loading and error gifs from the following animes: 

* The iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls
* K-On!
* Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka? (Is the Order a Rabbit?)

## Japanese

I did a lesson in Home 1 which went over the words: 猫 (cat), 鳥 (bird), 犬 (dog) and some phrases that use them.
