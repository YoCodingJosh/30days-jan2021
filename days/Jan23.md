## Angular

I implemented the stats loading screen that shows a random anime gif and random loading text periodically. I also got it to show the user name and profile picture, and fetching the generated stats.

All I have to do now is figure out how to render the stats and c3 graphs, then I will reach parity with the clunky old version.

## 日本語

I did a practice lesson in Hiragana 1 (which is the first lesson lol). It just goes over some of the letters and numbers like あ, う, 七(なな), 六(ろく), etc.
