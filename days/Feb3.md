## Japanese

Did a lesson in Counting which covered different usages of the つ counter in sentences like: 机が七つあります。(There are seven desks.) and 椅子が五つあります。(There are five chairs.)

Also watched this video that covers the days of the week and days of the month: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnoZE51WZg4&list=PL4071737C12790477&index=3
