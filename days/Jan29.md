This is the final stretch! Just 10 more days to go (as I started late, on Jan 8).

## 日本語

Did a practice lesson on Katakana 2, which covers names of cities and countries like: ロンドン (London); ブラジル (Brazil); etc.

and I also did a lesson on Home 1 which covers phrases like: トイレがあります。(There is a restroom.); 部屋はどこですか？ (Where is the room?); 学校は日本にあります。(The school is in Japan.); カメラはどこありますか？ (Where is the camera?).
