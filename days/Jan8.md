## Practice Japanese

I practiced counting, which is relatively different than counting in English.

In English, we would say "There are two chairs." in Japanese it goes like "椅子がニつあります。" Where 二(ni) is the word for two, but when it refers to counting things, it's 二つ(futatsu). Also 九つ(kokonotsu) rhymes with coconuts haha.

I also studied up a bit on basic conversational grammar, specifically sentence ending particles like よ(yo) and ね(ne) which is very interesting. ね can be used to make a sentence more polite like ごめん versus ごめんね which both mean sorry. It can also be used as a "tag question" like "The weather's great, isn't it?". よ is used to make awareness of something that may not have been previously known or that there as doubt about.
