## Angular

I completed the "Angular: Getting Started" course on Pluralsight, woot woot 🎉

I also started work on porting some of the functionality of AnimeStats to Angular. I started with a button that kicks off the authorization with MAL. It sends a POST to my server that it processes and sends back a PKCE, state, client_id, session_id, and weGood (which is if the user already has a session). I pretty much had to rewrite the UI logic for Angular, which was pretty easy and less code. Next steps are to store the data, generate the authorization url, and redirect the user to that url.

## Japanese

I did a review of Hiragana (Hiragana 2 on Duolingo) and reviewed some of the letters like よ(yo), や(ya), き(ku), and others.

I also did a lesson on Counting which strangely introduced some a words: 卵(tamago = egg) and using it in sentences about counting like 卵お一個食べます。= I will eat one egg.
