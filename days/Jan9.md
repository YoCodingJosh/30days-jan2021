## Practice Japanese

I took a refresher (Intro 1) and brushed up on some basic Kanji-Hiragana mappings.

* 日本 = にほん = Japan
* 学生 = がくせい = student
* 本田 = ほんだ = Honda
* and others

I also practiced the Home 1 lesson which goes over words like pet (ペット) and restroom (トイレ) and using them in sentences.

* Where is the restroom? = トイレはどこですか？
* Is this a toilet? = これはトイレですか？
* This is my pet. = これは私のペットです。
* Is this my table? = これは僕のテーブルですか？
