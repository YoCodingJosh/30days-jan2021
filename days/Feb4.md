## 日本語

I watched a cool video on swearing in Japanese: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIPsf-_Amzs it was very educational lol
 
 I also did a practice lesson on Hiragana 4 which reviewed words like くだもの (fruit), 弁当 (bento, boxed lunch), お茶 (tea, specifically green tea), etc.

 I also completed the Home 1 lesson set which the final lesson was an overview of some of the kanji/pronunciation as well as using them in sentences: 僕の椅子はどこですか？ (Where is my chair?) 僕は子猫と子犬好きです。(I like kittens and puppies) etc.
